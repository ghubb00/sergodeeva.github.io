    <p>I have a good friend (who I met on a Chinese language course by the way). When she learned about my secret affair with programming, she and her husband told me that I should attend a programming meetup, to meet people who are the same as me love programming. I was telling them: “Yes, I definitely will”. But deep in my mind (or heart) I felt nervous about it: I thought my programming knowledge was not respectable, thus I should not pretend of being a developer and attend any programming events.</p>

<p>However recently I realised that the ultimate knowledge of something probably does not exist. Even experienced programmers are googling things, not just me. Plus I <a href="http://www.natalyakosenko.com/2018-05-31-falling-in-love-with-python">learned a new language (Python)</a>, which gave me some confidence. So I registered on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> and joined a few programming groups there.</p>

<p>In the first month I have attended 4 python-related meetups. It was a good experience overall: I learned some new things, met some interesting people who I hope to stay in touch with, and ate some free food too ;)</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/post_images/2018-06-29-google-ml.jpg" style="display:block" /></p>

<p>By the way, if I started talking about the food, so far the best meetup food I ate was during Singapore Python User Group meetup hosted by <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/jobs/singapore/">Zendesk</a>. Until now can’t forget those butter prawns and delicious beef… (sad there was no beer, but still… as Russians say “daryonomy konyu v zuby ne smotryat” which means that if you got something free, you should not complain).</p>

<p>There was one thing on all the meetups that I completly did not expect though. What I imagined about meetups was: a group of “hardcore” programmers meet, drink beer, eat pizza and talk about coding. In reality so far I got an impression that <strong>high percent of people attending programming meetups are not programmers at all</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Some people apparently just come to eat. So they grab the food and leave once they done with their dinner :)</li>
  <li>Surprisingly many people come for job finding/recruiting purposes. The companies that host such events apparently also hoping that some meetup visitors will convert into employees. However, I was chatting to a guy whose company have been hosting one of the events, he told me that so far none of the new hires happened as a result of the meetups organised by this company.</li>
  <li>Met some startupers who think that networking will somehow help their recently born businesses (which might be true, why not).</li>
  <li>Some people come to sell their IT-related stuff. After 2 meetups (out of 4 I visited) I was approched by a few people offering me their python/data/ML-related services.</li>
  <li>Met a bunch of marketers/data scientists who are using python for data analysys, ETL (extracting/transforming/loading the data) or for ML (machine learning).</li>
  <li>A few people come assuming that a Python meetup is the same thing as a programming course where they can learn how to create Github account or install PyCharm.</li>
</ol>

<p>Where are those “hardcore” pythonists that I created in my mind, I don’t know. Those who are ready to talk about coding non-stop. Well, I met a few of them actually, and look forward to meet them again during future meetups :)</p>

<p>As a conclusion, I hope that more real programmers will attend programming meetups. Because otherwise what is the purpose of programming meetups?</p>
